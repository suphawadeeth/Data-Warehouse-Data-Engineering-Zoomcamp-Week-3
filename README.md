# Data Warehouse & Big Query

This week we learned more about Data Warehouse & Big Query.

## What is Data Warehouse?
- Data Warehouse is a central repository to store data from various sources.
- Data might be transformed before getting loaded into a database (ETL).
- In some cases, data might not be transformed but it maintains inside the Data Warehouse (in a staging area). After data get transformed (ELT), which also happens inside the  Data Warehouse, then it will be loaded into a database.
 
## What is Big Query?
- BigQuery (BQ) is a serverless Data Warehouse, managed by Google.  
- BQ supports all data types and works across cloud. 
- And BQ supports SQL-like query, which we will be working on today



## Scope of Work

We will put knowledge from previous weeks into action.  
Tasks of week 3 are:
  1. Collect data from sources
  2. Store data in google cloud
  3. Work with data in Big Query
  4. Query data with SQL

And this week we are free to use any tools/method in our favorites. 
Since I've been working with the Prefect Orchestration tool in the past weeks. I chose to continue working with Prefect because of its simple yet effective.
